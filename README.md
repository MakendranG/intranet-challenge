## 📘 Acme Corp Intranet – Office Edition Frontend Challenge

> **A submission for [Frontend Challenge: Office Edition sponsored by Axero](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend/axero)**

🖥️ This project is a modern, minimal, and responsive intranet homepage built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** only. It simulates an internal portal that helps employees stay updated, collaborate, and access team resources.

- 🌟 Team Spotlight with Initial-Based Avatar  
- 🔗 Quick Links to Internal Resources  
- 🌤️ Real-Time Office Status Display
